Then we calculate the percentage of non-union employees by subtracting the union percentage from 100. Next, we calculate the percentage of women in the union by subtracting the percentage of men in the union from 100. Finally, we calculate the percentage of women in the non-union employees by multiplying the percentage of women in the union with the percentage of non-union employees and dividing by the union percentage. We round the result to two decimal places and print the answer.\nAction: \n```python\nmen_percentage = 50\nunion_percentage = 60\nmen_in_union_percentage = 70\n\nnon_union_percentage = 100 - union_percentage\nwomen_in_union_percentage = 100 - men_in_union_percentage\n\nwomen_in_non_union_percentage = (women_in_union_percentage / union_percentage) * non_union_percentage\n\nanswer = round(women_in_non_union_percentage, 2)\nprint(answer)\n```"
