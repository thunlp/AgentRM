The condition \"I can pickup b3\", \"I can pickup b2\", \"I can pickup b1\", \"b3 is on the table\" has already been satisfied, I should start by picking up block b2. By doing so, I'll ensure that the arm is holding b2, allowing me to manipulate it freely. Since b2 is currently on the table and is clear, it's a suitable candidate for pickup. Once I successfully pick up b2, I can proceed with further actions to arrange the blocks according to the goal conditions.\nAction: pickup b2"
