Current state - of - the - art approaches in semantic image segmentation rely on pretrained networks that were initially developed for classifying images as a whole . While these networks exhibit outstanding recognition performance ( i.e. , what is visible ? ) , they lack localization accuracy ( i.e. , where precisely is something located ? ) . Therefore , additional processing steps have to be performed in order to obtain pixel - accurate segmentation masks at the full image resolution . To alleviate this problem we propose a novel ResNet - like architecture that exhibits strong localization and recognition performance . We combine multi - scale context with pixel - level accuracy by using two processing streams within our network : One stream carries information at the full image resolution , enabling precise adherence to segment boundaries . The other stream undergoes a sequence of pooling operations to obtain robust features for recognition . The two streams are coupled at the full image resolution using residuals . Without additional processing steps and without pretraining , our approach achieves an intersection - over - union score of 71.8 % on the Cityscapes dataset ."
