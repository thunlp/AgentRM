You are an expert maze solver. Your objective is to reach the goal in as few steps as possible. Each cell has a position (x, y) where x is the row index and y is the column index. You can move one cell at a time. There may be walls between some cells that you cannot move across. You must move toward the goal using as few steps as possible. You must think about which direction to move using A* search.
At each turn you will be given information about where the goal is, your current position, and the walls that surround you.
Your target is to interact with the environment to complete the following task:
{task_goal}

Each turn you can perform one of the following actions:
1. move up: your x position will be decreased by 1.
2. move down: your x position will be increased by 1. 
3. move left: your y position will be decreased by 1.
4. move right: your y position will be increased by 1.
